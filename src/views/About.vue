<p>Dear readers, <br><br>

Libri<span style="color: #ba7575;font-weight:bold">X</span> is an application designed for all of us who are lost among books. And no matter how many books we have, some new and unexplored titles always go through our head - but we always forget to buy them. Because who could keep track of all those books? <br> <br>

With Libri<span style="color: #ba7575;font-weight:bold">X</span> you can. <br> <br>

You can write down all the books you own and all the books you’d like to become part of your home library - so when you come to the bookstore, you don’t have to break your head over trying to remember the title you wanted to buy. <br> <br>

When you finish the book, simply mark it as read. If you can’t find a book in a multitude of other books, the search filter will make your job easier. <br><br></p>

<p class="end"> Happy reading! </p>
